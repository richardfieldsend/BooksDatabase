** Part of a Series?

This book appears to be part of a broader time/alternate time-stream
series where the protagonists (a series of pretty cliched sci-fi
staples) travel between realities, including ones where the dinosaurs
never died out and others where the Japanese Empire discovered and, at
least partially conquered the Americas before Europeans did.

** Worth A Read?

If you need a quick read between other books then this isn't bad. It
won't stretch either  your imagination or your thinking processes, but
it is pretty entertaining.
