An interesting little book which sets out to describe a number of
'classic' computer problems held together in an 'Alice in Wonderland'
type story.

The one I remember being in there is the 'travelling salesman' where
you plot the best route for a travelling salesman to take to cover a
number of cities where the main rule is that they can't revisit
somewhere they have already been.  One of the best ways of finding an
answer, according to this story is to set the problem for a nest of
ants. They will attempt all the different routes and then mark the
best with pheromones which encourage other ants to take these superior
routes.

A fun, short little read which I am sure I will read again some day.
