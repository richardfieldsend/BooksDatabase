@Book{abbott92:_flatl,
	annote = {Flatlands is a remarkable book. A fantasy which is part maths, part
social satire and part adventure romp.  The story imagines a world
which exists in two dimensions. Society is strictly hierachical, with
people's position in that society ruled, and indicated by how many
corners you have. Into this flat world comes a three dimensional
character, a sphere who takes our narrator on an adventure in the
third dimension.},

	annote = {For Thursday Next, literary detective without equal, life should be
good. Riding high on a wave of celebrity following the safe return of
kidnapped Jane Eyre, Thursday ties the knot with the man she loves.

But marital bliss isn't quite as it should be. It turns out her
husband of one month actually drowned thirty-eight years ago, and no
one but Thursday has any memory of him at all.

Someone, somewhere is responsible.

Having barely caught her breath after The Eyre Affair, Thursday heads
back into fiction in search of the truth, discovering that paper
politicians, lost Shakespearean manuscripts, a flurry of near-fatal
coincidences and impending Armageddon are all part of a greater plan.

But whose? And why?
